.box work as an item

flex-wrap by default is no-wrap

flex-wrap:wrap // it wrap the div based on width

flex-wrap:wrap-reverese //it start from top to bottom (cross axis) but content will be from left to right(main axis)


if flex-direction is column and flex-wrap is wrap
then
element will go from top to bottom and wrap element will come in next column
